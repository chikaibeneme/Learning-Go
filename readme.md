# Go Crash Course

This repository contains my learning journey in Go. Below is a summary of the concepts I have learned so far:

## 1. Hello World
- Learned how to write a simple Go program.
- Example: Printing "Hello, World!" using the `fmt.Println` function.  
  [Code](01_hello/main.go)

## 2. Variables and Constants
- Learned how to declare variables using `var` and shorthand syntax.
- Learned about constants and their immutability.
- Example: Declaring variables and constants.  
  [Code](02_vars/main.go)

## 3. Packages and Modules
- Learned how to use built-in packages like `math`.
- Created a custom package `strutil` with a `Reverse` function.
- Example: Using custom and built-in packages.  
  [Code](03_packages/main.go)

## 4. Functions
- Learned how to define and call functions.
- Explored functions with parameters and return values.
- Example: Greeting function and summing two numbers.  
  [Code](04_functions/main.go)

## 5. Arrays and Slices
- Learned how to work with arrays and slices.
- Explored slicing and getting the length of slices.
- Example: Working with fruit slices.  
  [Code](05_arrays_slices/main.go)

## 6. Conditionals
- Learned how to use `if`, `else if`, and `switch` statements.
- Example: Checking conditions and using switch cases.  
  [Code](06_conditionals/main.go)

## 7. Loops
- Learned how to use `for` loops.
- Implemented the FizzBuzz problem.
- Example: Iterating numbers and printing results.  
  [Code](07_loops/main.go)

## 8. Maps
- Learned how to create and manipulate maps.
- Explored adding, retrieving, and deleting key-value pairs.
- Example: Managing email addresses in a map.  
  [Code](08_maps/main.go)

## 9. Range
- Learned how to use `range` to iterate over slices and maps.
- Example: Iterating over a map of email addresses.  
  [Code](09_range/main.go)

## 10. Pointers
- Learned how to use pointers to reference and modify values.
- Example: Changing a value using a pointer.  
  [Code](10_pointers/main.go)

## 11. Closures
- Learned how to create closures and maintain state within a function.
- Example: Summing numbers using a closure.  
  [Code](11_closures/main.go)

## 12. Structs
- Learned how to define and use structs.
- Explored methods with value and pointer receivers.
- Example: Creating a `Person` struct and defining methods like `greet`.  
  [Code](12_structs/main.go)

## 13. Interfaces
- Learned how to define and use interfaces.
- Explored polymorphism with different struct types implementing the same interface.
- Example: Calculating the area of shapes using an interface.  
  [Code](13_interfaces/main.go)

## 14. Web Server
- Learned how to create a simple web server using the `net/http` package.
- Example: Serving an index and about page.  
  [Code](14_web/main.go)
